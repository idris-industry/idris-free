`we can now forget not  only return and bind but  also  the fmap operation,  and  still recover the state monad through FFree (State s) construction. We no  longer  have  to  bother  defining  the  basic  monad  and  functor operations  in  the  first  place:  We  now  get  not  only  the Monad instance but also the Functor and Applicative instances for free.`
